**Date**: 2025-07-16
**Research Context**: Understanding AI memory systems and persistent context architectures

## Vector Databases as AI's Memory Layer

### Core Cognitive Performance
- **2025 Reality**: Vector databases are no longer support layer - they are core of cognitive performance
- **Memory Functions**: Store, retrieve, and rank semantically embedded data
- **AI Capabilities**: Enable AI to remember, adapt, and reason across tasks
- **Scalability Focus**: Moving toward billion-vector scale systems for trillion-parameter LLMs

### RAG Evolution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

#### Traditional RAG Process
1. **Query Conversion**: User question converted to vector representation
2. **Semantic Search**: Vector database retrieval of most relevant documents
3. **Context Injection**: Retrieved documents fed to LLM for grounded response
4. **Personalization**: AI knows case history, specific clauses, preferred terminology

#### Agentic RAG: Dynamic Context Retrieval
- **Tool Integration**: Semantic memory hooked as dynamic tool vs static step
- **Adaptive Querying**: Agent decides how many times to query memory
