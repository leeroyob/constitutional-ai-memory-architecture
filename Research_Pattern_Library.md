# Research Pattern Library
**Date Created**: 2025-07-16
**Purpose**: Capture successful research patterns for constitutional intelligence evolution

## Successful Search Query Patterns

### Technology Research
- **Pattern**: "[Technology] 2025 enterprise deployment best practices"
- **Success Rate**: High - captures current implementation guidance
- **Example**: "AI memory systems persistent context RAG vector databases 2025"
- **Why It Works**: Combines technology terms with year and implementation focus

### Governance & Compliance
- **Pattern**: "[Domain] governance frameworks [regulatory body] 2025"
- **Success Rate**: High - finds regulatory updates and frameworks
- **Example**: "AI safety governance frameworks constitutional training 2025"
- **Why It Works**: Specific to governance with temporal relevance

### Business Intelligence
- **Pattern**: "[Industry] [technology] business models pricing strategies"
- **Success Rate**: Medium-High - reveals commercial patterns
- **Example**: "AI infrastructure platform business models 2025 enterprise pricing SaaS"
- **Why It Works**: Combines business and technical perspectives

### Comparative Analysis
- **Pattern**: "[Option A] vs [Option B] 2025 comparison analysis"
- **Success Rate**: Medium - depends on topic maturity
- **Example**: "Anthropic vs OpenAI constitutional AI approaches"
- **Why It Works**: Direct comparison triggers analytical content

## Multi-Round Research Patterns

### Funnel Pattern (Broad → Specific)
1. **Round 1**: General landscape query
   - "AI governance 2025 trends"
2. **Round 2**: Specific aspect from Round 1
   - "Constitutional AI implementation challenges"
3. **Round 3**: Deep dive on key finding
   - "Public input constitutional AI development process"

### Spoke Pattern (Central → Related)
1. **Center**: Core technology or concept
   - "Vector databases AI memory"
2. **Spokes**: Related implementation areas
   - "RAG systems 2025"
   - "Agentic AI memory patterns"
   - "Enterprise vector database deployment"

### Layer Pattern (Surface → Deep)
1. **Surface**: Public information, news, trends
   - "AI memory platform news 2025"
2. **Technical**: Implementation details, architecture
   - "Vector database architecture patterns"
3. **Strategic**: Business implications, future directions
   - "AI memory monetization strategies"

## Cross-Domain Connection Patterns

### Technology → Business
- Start with technical capability
- Search for commercial applications
- Investigate pricing and business models
- Extract strategic implications

### Regulation → Implementation
- Begin with regulatory requirements
- Research compliance approaches
- Find implementation examples
- Document best practices

### Theory → Practice
- Start with conceptual frameworks
- Search for real-world applications
- Find case studies and examples
- Extract practical patterns

## Query Evolution Patterns

### Terminology Discovery
- Initial: "AI memory systems"
- Discovered: "vector databases," "RAG," "embedding"
- Evolved: "vector databases RAG embedding billion-scale"

### Stakeholder Identification
- Initial: "AI governance"
- Discovered: "Anthropic," "EU AI Act," "NIST"
- Evolved: "Anthropic constitutional AI EU AI Act compliance"

### Temporal Refinement
- Initial: "AI trends"
- Discovered: Rapid evolution, recent changes
- Evolved: "AI developments 2025 latest updates"

## Failed Pattern Analysis

### Too Narrow Initial Searches
- **Problem**: "Constitutional AI Claude implementation"
- **Issue**: Too specific, missed broader context
- **Solution**: Start broader, narrow through rounds

### Assumption-Based Queries
- **Problem**: "How companies use constitutional AI"
- **Issue**: Assumed widespread adoption
- **Solution**: First verify existence/adoption level

### Single-Source Dependency
- **Problem**: Relying on one comprehensive result
- **Issue**: Missed alternative perspectives
- **Solution**: Always seek multiple viewpoints

## Pattern Combination Strategies

### Comprehensive Coverage
Combine:
- Landscape query (broad context)
- Technical query (implementation details)
- Business query (commercial aspects)
- Future query (trends and evolution)

### Validation Approach
Combine:
- Industry source (vendor perspective)
- Academic source (research perspective)
- Practitioner source (implementation reality)
- Regulatory source (compliance requirements)

## Emerging Successful Patterns

### "Latest developments" + Specific Players
- "Anthropic OpenAI latest developments 2025"
- Captures competitive landscape and recent changes

### "Best practices" + Implementation Context
- "Enterprise AI deployment best practices 2025"
- Yields practical guidance over theory

### Problem + Solution Format
- "AI governance challenges solutions 2025"
- Triggers problem-solving content

### "Revolutionary" / "Breakthrough" + Domain
- Surfaces cutting-edge developments
- Identifies paradigm shifts
- Reveals emerging opportunities

## Meta-Patterns

### Research Session Success Indicators
1. **Query Evolution**: Questions change based on findings
2. **Cross-References**: Multiple domains connect
3. **Depth Achievement**: Surface → technical → strategic
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar themes across sources
5. **Actionable Insights**: From information to implementation

### Research Quality Metrics
- **Coverage**: Multiple perspectives captured
- **Currency**: Information is recent/relevant
- **Depth**: Technical details obtained
- **Connections**: Cross-domain insights found
- **Application**: Practical implications clear
